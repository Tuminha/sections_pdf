<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Implant placement in the posterior maxilla is a challenging procedure when the available bone is reduced because of atrophy of the bone crest. Different materials and techniques have been proposed to augment bone volume in the posterior maxilla in order to allow for implant placement. Maxillary sinus augmentation technique is a common surgical procedure for creating adequate bone volume before implant placement.</p><p>While a lateral approach in sinus lifting is generally indicated in case of less than 4 to 5 mm of residual bone height, 1-3 a crestal approach was described as a viable treatment in the presence of greater bone height. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> Tatum described the first technique for transalveolar maxillary sinus lift and subsequent placement of implants in 1986. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> In the original technique, after fracturing sinus floor, an implant was placed and submerged during healing phase. A modification of this protocol was then proposed by Summers in 1994. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> In this technique, implant site is prepared using a set of osteotomes that also allow increasing bone density through a lateral compression. The osteotomemediated technique allows preservation of bone because drilling is avoided.</p><p>Such transalveolar approach is more conservative than the lateral approach because only a small osteotomy is performed at crestal level. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Though, the main drawback is that both the sinus floor lifting and the bone grafting procedure is conducted blindly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> In both procedures, after lifting of the Schneiderian membrane, various types of bone grafting material can fill the resulting space. However, several studies showed that even without using bone grafting material, the stabilization of blood clot after elevation of the sinus floor can be sufficient to obtain new bone formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate implant survival rate (SR) after osteotome-mediated sinus lift procedure and evaluate factors potentially affecting the clinical outcome.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Search Strategy</head><p>An electronic search was conducted via MEDLINE (Pubmed) in the dental literature to select only human clinical trials published from 1986 to December 2010. The search terms used were "sinus lift," "sinus augmentation," "sinus grafting," "sinus elevation," "osteotome AND implants," "osteotome AND sinus lift," "osteotome AND sinus augmentation," "osteotome AND sinus grafting," "osteotome AND sinus elevation," "crestal AND sinus lift," "crestal AND sinus augmentation," "crestal AND sinus grafting," and "crestal AND sinus elevation" and were chosen accordingly with previously published reviews. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> No language restriction was placed.</p><p>A manual search was performed of the bibliographies of the selected articles and of the reviews resulting from the electronic search. In addition, a hand search of issues from 1995 to December 2010 was undertaken on the following journals: British Journal of </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inclusion Criteria</head><p>This systematic review included prospective and retrospective cohort studies according to the following inclusion criteria:</p><p>• publications concerning transcrestal sinus lift in combination with implant placement; • follow-up time of at least 1 year after prosthetic rehabilitation;</p><p>• studies with at least 20 patients treated; and • studies presenting data on implant SR.</p><p>When papers from the same group of authors were identified, with very similar databases of patients, materials, methods, and outcomes, the authors were contacted to clarify whether the pool of patients was indeed the same. In case of multiple publications relative to consecutive phases of the same study, only the most recent data (those with the longer follow-up) were considered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection of the Studies</head><p>Two reviewers (SC and ST) independently screened abstracts and full-text of the eligible articles for possible inclusion. In case of disagreement, a joint decision was taken by discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Extraction</head><p>Two reviewers (SC and MDF) independently recorded data from the selected studies on a previously designed data extraction form.</p><p>Data regarding population (sample size, mean age) and the characteristics of the sinus lifting technique were extracted. Implant length was categorized into subclasses (less than 8.5 mm, 8.5 to 10 mm, &gt;10 mm). Mean weighted SRs at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years of follow-up from implant placement were estimated, taking into account the sample size, the follow-up duration, and the timing of failures of each study. Data concerning surgical complications (like nose bleeding and membrane perforation) were also recorded.</p><p>Residual bone height was classified according to a threshold value (less than 5 mm and more than or equal to 5 mm). For studies that provided only the mean residual bone height value, it was assumed that all implants had been placed in crest with residual bone height equal to the mean value. One-year SRs were estimated for implants placed in &lt;5 mm or e160</p><p>Clinical Implant Dentistry and Related Research, Volume 14, Supplement 1, 2012 different studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>All comparisons between subgroups for any variable (follow-up duration, use of bone graft, implant length, residual bone height) were made by using Pearson's chisquare test. A probability level of p = .05 was considered as the threshold for significance. Odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were also estimated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> summarizes the article selection process. The initial electronic search provided 420 items. After screening of the titles and abstracts, 351 articles were excluded because of not strictly pertinent to the aims of this review. A total of 69 full-text articles were eligible and underwent full-text evaluation. Of these, 50 articles were excluded because of not fulfilling the inclusion criteria. The most frequent reasons for exclusion were inadequate sample size, too short follow-up, and inadequate data reporting. A total of 19 studies were finally included for data analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combined Effect of Grafting and Ridge Height</head><p>The data were further split by combining the analysis on grafting and that on ridge height. When a grafting procedure was performed, overall implant survival was 87.0% and 96.2% for residual ridge height of &lt;5 mm (n = 46) and 35 mm (n = 1198), respectively. The difference was significant (p = .002; OR = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.10, 0.64).

The article by Pjetursson and colleagues, in which the transalveolar technique was performed either with or without grafting, had to be excluded from the latter analysis as it did not provide sufficient details for splitting the data as required. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intrasurgical Complications</head><p>Nose bleeding was reported in 0.3% of cases in which a grafting procedure was adopted (n = 1367) and in 1.6% of cases performed without grafting (n = 1764). The difference was significant (p = .0003; OR = 5.50; 95% CI = 1.92, 15.71). Sinus membrane perforation was reported in 2.5% and 1.7% of cases performed with or without grafting, respectively. Such difference was not significant (p = .12; OR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.41, 1.11).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Previous systematic reviews suggested that the cumulative SRs for implants placed with transalveolar technique are comparable with those relative to implants placed in native maxillary bone. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> However, the advantage of using bone grafting material in the osteotome technique was not clearly demonstrated and discussed in the above-mentioned reviews. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> In the present study, the SR for implants placed in combination with osteotome-mediated sinus floor elevation was around 95% at 3-year follow-up demonstrating the high standard of performance of this treatment option. Implant failures occurred mainly during the first year after prosthetic loading, while only about one-third of the total failures occurred subsequently.</p><p>Several studies showed that neo-osteogenesis may occur even when the sinus membrane is lifted and the underneath space filled by blood clot. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> It was hypothesized that blood clot can induce neoosteogenesis through the stimulation of osteoprogenitor cells from the periosteum. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> Other authors observed the spontaneous bone formation under the Schneiderian membrane after tooth extraction or cyst removal in the posterior maxilla. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> It was also postulated that the membrane itself has osteogenic potential that may support bone neoformation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> These considerations provided the biological background to perform the transalveolar sinus lifting procedure without the use of any graft material. As evidenced in the present review, studies in which the sinus membrane is lifted without using bone grafts are relatively recent in comparison with those using grafting material. Moreover no statistically significant difference was observed as regard to implant SR at 1-year follow-up (p = .32) between studies using or not using a grafting material. Thus, it could be postulated that the use of grafting material should not be considered fundamental for achieving successful outcomes in the transalveolar technique.</p><p>Some of the included studies emphasized the finding that implant failures occur more frequently when using short implants, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> suggesting an inverse relation between implant failure rate and implant length. Such relation, however, could not be confirmed by the present review. Implants less than 8.5 mm long displayed an SR comparable with longer ones, as also reported in previous studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> If the implant length is appropriately chosen in function of the available bone, and the prosthetic design is correct, the use of short or extra-short implants is not contraindicated and may as well lead to successful outcomes as shown by recent literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> Analysis of residual ridge height was limited by incomplete reported data. It was observed that, generally, the use of bone grafting procedure was not correlated with initial bone height, although no significant correlation could be obtained. Otherwise, also in studies where reported mean initial bone height was less than 3 mm, the sinus lifting procedure without grafting was successful and without severe adverse sequelae. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> While residual ridge height is considered a fundamental factor to achieve implant primary stability immediately after placement, which is critical to successful osseointegration, residual ridge height analysis lead to other relevant considerations. It could be postulated that bone neoformation in the transalveolar technique may not depend only on residual bone height because all anatomical local components (including Schneiderian membrane and periosteum) together may contribute. This concept implies that, in order to obtain neo-osteogenesis without the use of bone grafting material, the integrity of these structures should be preserved as much as possible during surgical procedure. The analysis concerning intrasurgical complications showed substantial equivalence in membrane perforation rate between cases treated using and not using grafting procedure, the incidence being rather low as compared with perforation rates reported for the lateral approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref> It should be noted, however, that a number of unnoticed perforations of the membrane should be reasonably taken into account, due to the blindness of the procedure regarding this aspect. Therefore, the results of such analysis should be interpreted cautiously.</p><p>Thus, similar to the scientific literature pertinent to sinus lifting with lateral approach, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47</ref> successful implant rehabilitation could be achieved with transalveolar technique also in cases with scarce residual bone height.</p><p>The low implant SR found when grafting procedure is used in the presence of a ridge less than 5 mm high (87%), even though not significantly different from the outcome of procedures without grafting in similar ridge height, could be misleading. Indeed, such a value was estimated using a very low sample size (n = 46) respect to the other subgroups, and most failures derive from a single study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> Clearly, a higher sample size is needed to get more insight in this issue. Some limitations could be identified in the present paper. First, the absence of randomized controlled trials prevents the estimation of the true efficacy of the use of bone grafting material in the transalveolar maxillary sinus augmentation procedure. Incomplete data reporting in most of the included studies precluded the possibility to perform a consistent meta-analysis. Only weighted mean implant SRs could be estimated and used for comparisons. Furthermore, the absence of individual patients' data for most variables, such as the residual bone height, could be a confounding factor in all comparative analyses. Finally, the use of the implant instead of the patient as the analysis unit was due as most of the included studies did not provide information at patient level about the failures.</p><p>Within the limitations of the study, we can assume that the transalveolar sinus augmentation technique could be a viable treatment in case of localized atrophy in the posterior maxilla even in case of minimal residual bone height. The authors could find no differences in terms of SRs in relation with the use of bone grafting material or not.</p><p>Further RCT studies with larger sample size and precise description of anatomical features of the bone crest could be useful for gaining more insight on this treatment option.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1Flow of articles during the selection process.</figDesc></figure>
